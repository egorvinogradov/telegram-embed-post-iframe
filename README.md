## Problem
Telegram doesn't allow embedding channel posts via IFrame. [The only option](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/post) is to embed posts via the `<script>` tag. However, script tags aren't supported on many platforms such as Notion.

## Solution
This project generates a unique URL that can be embedded using IFrames. See live demo: https://telegram-post-iframe.surge.sh
